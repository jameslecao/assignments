2. Challenges : A challenge I had while creating this code was understanding the converting and exception portion of it. The coding was not difficult but took me a second to understand

           import java.util.Scanner; 
        
        public class Pedometer { 
            
            public static double stepsToMiles(int steps) throws Exception {
                if (steps < 0) {
                    throw new Exception("Exception: Negative step count entered.");
                }
                return steps / 2000.0;
            }
        
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in); 
                int steps = scnr.nextInt();            
        
                try {
                    double miles = stepsToMiles(steps);
                    System.out.printf("%.2f", miles);
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    System.out.println(e.getMessage());
                }
            }
        }
